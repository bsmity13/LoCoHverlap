`LoCoHverlap` (pronounced "Loke - Overlap") is an R package to compare animal range overlaps using Local Convex Hull (LoCoH) home range estimators and Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). It streamlines the following workflow:  
    1. Fit LoCoH home ranges to sets of animal locations.  
    2. Convert fitted LoCoHs to utilization distributions (UD) estimated on a raster.  
    3. Measure overlap using the continuous metric EMD.  

A full description of this method and its use in animal ecology is currently in prep.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsmity13/LoCoHverlap")
```

## Current Status

This package is in the early stages of development and is not yet functional. The currently planned updates are:  

  - [ ] Basic workflow
    - [x] Basic function to fit 1 LoCoH
    - [ ] Basic function to rasterize 1 LoCoH
    - [ ] Basic function to calculate EMD between any number of LoCoHs
  - [ ] Seasonal overlap workflow
    - [ ] Iterate basic workflow over individuals in a season
    - [ ] Compare individuals within a season
    - [ ] Compare an individual across seasons
  - [ ] Moving window workflow
    - [ ] Use moving window to implement basic workflow and compare consecutive ranges
  - [x] Simulated example data to be used in help files and vignettes
  - [ ] Vignette for each workflow
    - [ ] Basic
    - [ ] Seasonal
    - [ ] Moving window
    
This README will be updated as new functionality comes online or workflow is revised.
